|Argument|Default|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
|Install zsh flag|`true`| A `true`/`false` flag that indicates whether zsh should be installed. |
|Non-root user|`automatic`| Specifies a user in the container other than root that should be created or modified. A value of `automatic` will cause the script to check for a user called `vscode`, then `node`, `codespace`, and finally a user with a UID of `1000` before falling back to `root`. A value of `none` will skip this step. |
|User UID|`automatic`| A specific UID (e.g. `1000`) for the user that will be created modified. A value of `automatic` will pick a free one if the user is created. |
|User GID|`automatic`| A specific GID (e.g. `1000`) for the user's group that will be created modified. A value of `automatic` will pick a free one if the group is created. |
| Upgrade packages flag | `true` | A `true`/`false` flag that indicates whether packages should be upgraded to the latest for the distro. |
| Install Oh My *! flag | `true` | A `true`/`false` flag that indicates whether Oh My Bash! and Oh My Zsh! should be installed. |
